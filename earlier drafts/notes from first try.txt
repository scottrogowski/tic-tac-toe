push (1)
status? none
continue

push (1 to 2)
status? none

push (2 to 3)
status? i won
am i person? yes
do i want to look for better options? no	
note length of stack = 3

pop (2 to 3)
length of stack? 2
2 = 3 - 1 where status is none, so...

pop (1 to 2)
we already know status
stack = 1
continue...

push (1 to 3)
stack = 2
status? none
2 = 3 -1 where status is none, so ...

pop (1 to 3)
we already know status
stack = 1

[and same w 4 and 5, and 2 on stack = 1]

now stack is empty

push (3)
stack = 1, so check status
status = i won
do i want to look for better options? no
note length of stack = 1
this length < previous best, so
this becomes the new length
note that it is 3

we need a couple pieces of information:
length of stack
player
status

make it so that once a square has been taken, it is removed from the list of avail squares

do i want to do shortest length, or most paths to victory? if there's a victory right there, i wld want computer to take it
maybe, if there's a right answer now, do that. but otherwise, do whatever paths has highest likelihood of winning
