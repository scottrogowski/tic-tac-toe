before for loop:
	save state of board
	initialize the worst possible outcome for each side (which i think wld be same code as for matches)

for loop is all possible next moves, or avail_moves

then, do one of those moves (on a copy of the game board)
	then, run the fn of this state of the game board
	get the best move from that game board state

then, revert the game back to its saved state

if the best score is better than my best (which initializes as my worst), replace best
